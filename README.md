Although I imagine there to be an easy solution and I think I became close to accomplishing it, I had trouble writing code that would automatically search for Ace of Base's "The Sign" when no value was input to the spotify search. I tried running separate functions and calling it in the spotify search function and also using if/else statements. Unfortunately, I was unable to do this on my own.
